# Scatter Sync
Scatter Sync is a software for synchronising files across devices using GitHub. It allows for different local paths to be specified on different devices for the same given file.

It is intended for small config, settings, or save files that may be scattered across a device. Keeping this type of file consistent across devices can be incredibly annoying. Scatter Sync solves this issue.

## Build Instructions
CMake is required for building this program. If using VSCode, the [CMakeTools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cmake-tools) extension is reccomended, but not required. [wxWidgets](https://wxwidgets.org/) is also required for building.

After installing all prerequisites, simply build with CMake and run the resultant executable. If something goes wrong, refer to [Common Build Issues](#common-build-issues).

## Downloading Scatter Sync Executables
Refer to the [latest release](https://github.com/TehhX/ScatterSync/releases/latest) for a precompiled Linux or Windows executable with the latest version of Scatter Sync. They should work out of the box, just place them in whichever local directory you prefer. From there, just follow the [End-User Instructions](#end-user-instructions).
